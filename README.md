# 👋 Hi there, I'm Vanda Oliveira

### 🚀 Bridging the gap between storytelling and software engineering.

With a solid background in communications and a daily role in the economic media landscape, I'm currently decoding the world of low-level programming. I believe that logic and creativity are two sides of the same coin.

### About Me
* **Experienced with:** C, Shell, Git, Linux, and AI-driven workflows.
* **Currently focused on:** Low-level programming, UNIX systems, and Object-Oriented Programming (C++).
* **Goal:** To integrate software engineering principles into Corporate & Branded Content strategy and automation.
